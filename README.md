# LooseLetter

N people are sitting around a table to play a game. Each of these people has a name. On each turn, a random number k [1<=k<=N] is chosen. The kth person loses one letter* from his/her name. If a person has no letters left in his/her name, he/she loses the game, and will be removed from the table. The last person who is still in the table, wins the game.
